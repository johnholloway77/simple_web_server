## Assignment Goals
The objective of this assignment is to write a simple web server that speaks a limited version of HTTP/1.0 as defined in RFC1945.
Your program should behave as one would expect from a regular system daemon. That is, it should detach from the controlling terminal and run in the background, accept multiple simultaneous connections, not generate any messages on stdout unless in debugging mode etc.
